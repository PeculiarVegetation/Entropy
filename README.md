# Entropy
A WIP choose-your-own-adventure reader and creation tool written in Java.

## Dependencies
**[JSON-java](https://github.com/stleary/JSON-java)**

## Building
* Import the project into your IDE of choice.
* Include the JSON-java jar linked in "Dependencies" as an external library.
* Build the project as usual, using GUI.java as the main file.

## Creating Pages for Entropy
Currently, Entropy reads JSON files. To get an idea for the general format these should be in, take a look at testing/start.json and testing/option_1.json.

## Planned Features
* Support arbitrary numbers of choices for each page, instead of a maximum limit of four.
* Improve UI to be more accomodating of high-resolution and small screens.
* Create an in-application page editing/creation tool.
* Add support for inline images and some markup.
* Lots more, most likely.
